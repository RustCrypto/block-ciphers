//! AES block ciphers implementation using AES-NI instruction set.
//!
//! This crate does not implement any software fallback and does not
//! automatically check CPUID, so if you are using this crate make sure to run
//! software on an appropriate hardware or to use software fallback
//! (e.g. from [`aes-soft`](https://crates.io/crates/aes-soft) crate) with
//! runtime detection of AES-NI availability (e.g. by using
//! [`cupid`](https://crates.io/crates/cupid) crate).
//!
//! When using this crate do not forget to enable `aes` target feature,
//! otherwise you will get a compilation error. You can do it either by using
//! `RUSTFLAGS="-C target-feature=+aes"` or by editing your `.cargo/config`.
//!
//! Ciphers functionality is accessed using `BlockCipher` trait from the
//! [`cipher`](https://docs.rs/cipher) crate.
//!
//! # CTR mode
//! In addition to core block cipher functionality this crate provides optimized
//! CTR mode implementation. This functionality requires additionall `ssse3`
//! target feature and feature-gated behind `ctr` feature flag, which is enabled
//! by default. If you only need block ciphers, disable default features with
//! `default-features = false` in your `Cargo.toml`.
//!
//! AES-CTR functionality is accessed using traits from
//! [`cipher`](https://docs.rs/cipher) crate.
//!
//! # Vulnerability
//! Lazy FP state restory vulnerability can allow local process to leak content
//! of the FPU register, in which round keys are stored. This vulnerability
//! can be mitigated at the operating system level by installing relevant
//! patches. (i.e. keep your OS updated!) More info:
